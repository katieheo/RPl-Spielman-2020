## Analysis

I will be working on ... 

1. Mapping national SoVI levels. 

2. Create an output table of factor loadings for national SoVI.

3. Reweighting the SoVI by the percent variance to evaluate the internal consistency of the SoVI model. 

## Results

1. Mapping the levels will make for a clear visualization of social vulnerability nationally. It will most likely produce a map that will allow for a broader understanding of regional variations. 

2. Creating an output table of factor loadings for national SoVI may enhance accuracy by quantifying the influence of different variables on the vulnerability index, providing insight into the relative importance of each factor at a national level.

3. We hope that reweighting the SoVI by the percent variance adds clarity to the study by evaluating the internal consistency of the model, helping researchers assess the reliability and theoretical consistency of the vulnerability index on a national scale.

## Discussion

1. This not only allows for the identification of geographic patterns but also facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the overall vulnerability landscape at a national scale. Visualization through maps enhances communication and accessibility, enabling researchers and the public to grasp the nuances of social vulnerability across diverse regions.

2. Generating an output table of factor loadings for national SoVI is essential for transparency and in-depth analysis of the model. Factor loadings provide insights into the strength and direction of relationships between the original variables and the derived factors in the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI). This may help in understanding which variables contribute most significantly to the overall vulnerability scores. 

3. Reweighting the SoVI based on the percent variance serves to assess the internal consistency of the model and improve its theoretical alignment. This process will allow for a nuanced examination of the contribution of each principal component, considering their relative importance in explaining variability. The discussion of the reweighted model's performance compared to the original model may provide valuable insights into potential improvements and limitations of the SoVI methodology.
